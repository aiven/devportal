Welcome to Aiven Developer Portal
=================================

Aiven offers managed services for the best open source data technologies, on a cloud of your choice.

Clouds
------

We offer multiple cloud options because we believe that everyone should have access to great data platforms to host their applications. Our customers tell us they love the multi-cloud approach because they know that they aren't locked in to one particular cloud platform for all their data needs.

You can choose from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure Cloud, DigitalOcean Cloud and UpCloud, and then pick the region where your service should be hosted.


Pricing
-------

You are billed on a monthly basis, and you only pay for the time that the service is running. Data transfer costs are included. 
You can check more on our `Pricing page <https://aiven.io/pricing>`_.

Features
--------

Aiven offers everything you'd expect but here are some highlights:

* Self-service and interuption-free **service upgrades**. Some of our services allow "downgrade" as well. You know, just in case.

* Read-only **replicas**. Whether for peace of mind, a reporting backend, you can easily spin up a read replica of your database on a different cloud.

* Database **forking**. Create a fork of your database to test migrations, upgrades, or anything else you'd like to try in a safe space before you go ahead.
