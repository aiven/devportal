This is a Flink® title
======================

This is the first non-title reference to Flink.

This is the second non-title reference to Flink.

We also reference Kafka® once, and say ClickHouse® and then again ClickHouse.

Other registered names: Cassandra®, OpenSearch®, PostgreSQL®, InfluxDB®, Grafana®.

A word at the end of a line is OK: Kubernetes®

This is a Redis®* title
-----------------------

And Redis®* is registered and needs an asterisk. But the second Redis does not.
