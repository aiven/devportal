Custom plans
------------
Aiven for Grafana plans are optimized for working well in the various clouds supported by Aiven. The plans also enable migration between the clouds. Should any available plans not be an ideal fit for your workload, we're happy to tailor a custom plan for you to better suit your needs.

Billing
-------
All Aiven services, including Aiven for Grafana, are billed based on actual usage, which means you only pay for what you use: no up-front fees and no termination charges.

The minimum hourly charge unit is one hour. Powering off or deleting a service stops the accumulation of charges immediately. We calculate your final bill based on your consumption over that period and deliver it as a single invoice per project. For generating a consolidated invoice across multiple projects, `manage billing groups in Aiven Console <https://docs.aiven.io/docs/platform/howto/use-billing-groups.html>`_.
