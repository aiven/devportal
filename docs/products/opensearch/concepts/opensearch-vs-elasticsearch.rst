OpenSearch® vs Elasticsearch
============================

OpenSearch® is the open source continuation of the original Elasticsearch project. When `Elastic moved to a restrictive license <https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change>`_, the changes meant that third parties were not able to continue to offer Elasticsearch as a service. The community (including Aiven) joined forces to create and maintain OpenSearch based on the last open source licensed releases of both Elasticsearch and Kibana (v7.10.2).

The v1.0 release of OpenSearch should be very much similar to the Elasticsearch release that it is based on and Aiven encourages all customers to upgrade at their earliest convenience. This is to ensure that your platforms are in a position to continue to receive upgrades in the future.
