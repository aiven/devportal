Estimate maximum number of connection
=====================================

The number of simultaneous connections in Aiven for Redis depends on the total available memory on the server. 

You can use the following to estimate:

.. math::

   {max\_number\_of\_connections} = 4\times m

where "m" represents the memory in megabytes (binary). With at least 10,000 connections available, even on the smallest servers. For example, on a server with 4GB memory (4,096 MB binary), the simultaneous connections are:

.. math::

    4\times 4096 = 16384 {\ connections}

.. note::

    Make sure to convert the memory unit to megabytes (binary) unit.
