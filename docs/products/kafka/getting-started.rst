Getting started with Aiven for Apache Kafka®
============================================

Aiven services are managed in the Aiven `web
console <https://console.aiven.io/>`__ . When you first log in to the
console with your email address and password, you will see the
**Services** view, which shows you all the services in the currently
selected project.

Aiven for Apache Kafka® is a managed service offered by Aiven. The first step in using Aiven for Apache Kafka® is to create a service. You can do so using the `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_ or the :doc:`Aiven CLI </docs/tools/cli>`.
