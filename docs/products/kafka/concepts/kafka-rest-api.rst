Apache Kafka REST API
=====================
`Karapace <https://github.com/aiven/karapace>`_ provides a RESTful interface to your Apache Kafka® cluster, allowing you to produce and consume messages and perform administrative cluster work. 

Authorization can be enabled for Apache Kafka REST APIs using Apache Kafka REST proxy authorization. The authorization rules are based on :doc:`Kafka ACLs </docs/products/kafka/concepts/acl>`. For information, see :doc:`Apache Kafka REST proxy authorization <../karapace/concepts/kafka-rest-proxy-authorization>`.
