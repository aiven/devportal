Karapace
===============================
What is Karapace?
----------------------------------------
Karapace is an Aiven built open-source Schema Registry for Apache Kafka, and provides a central repository to store and retrieve schemas. It consists of a Schema Registry and a REST API. All Kafka services on Aiven support both these features (Schema registry and REST API), and as a user, based on your requirements, you can enable or disable them. 

Why Karapace?
--------------------------

Karapace supports storing schemas in a central repository, which clients can access to serialize and deserialize messages. The schemas also maintain their own version histories and can be checked for compatibility between their different respective versions.
Karapace rest provides a RESTful interface to your Apache Kafka cluster, allowing you to perform tasks such as producing and consuming messages and performing administrative cluster work while using the web language.
