=======================================================

To enable Apache Kafka® Connect on Aiven for Apache Kafka® services, those should be running on business or premium plans.

.. Warning::

    Aiven provides the option to run Apache Kafka Connect on the same nodes as your Apache Kafka cluster, sharing the resources. This is a low-cost way to get started with Apache Kafka Connect. A standalone Aiven for Apache Kafka® Connect allows you to scale independently, offers more CPU time and memory for the Kafka Connect service and reduces load on nodes, making the cluster more stable.

1. Log into `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io>`_ and select the Aiven for Apache Kafka service where to enable Apache Kafka Connect

2. Select **Connectors** from the sidebar. 
3. On the **Connectors** page, click **Enable connector on this service**.
