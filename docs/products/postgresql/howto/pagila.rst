Sample dataset: Pagila
======================

Aiven provides a sample database you can import in your Aiven for PostgreSQL service. This page covers information about the database and the procedure to get it up and running.

Pagila is a PostgreSQL port of the `Sakila Sample Database <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/>`_. The examples here use one from ``devrimgunduz``, `version 2.1.0 <https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila>`_.

Sakila (and thus, Pagila) is a database representing a DVD rental store (remember those?!), containing information about films (like title, category, actresses), rental stores (like address, staff members, customers) and rentals, where a customer rents a film from a store through its staff.

With all these relational information, Pagila is a perfect fit to play around with PostgreSQL and the SQL language.

Load Pagila via the web console
-------------------------------

Before exploring the Pagila database, follow the :doc:`create new service article<../../../platform/howto/create_new_service>` to spin up a PostgreSQL instance.

With your new PostgreSQL service, you can quickly load the sample dataset by clicking on the "Load sample dataset" button.

    :alt: A screenshot of the Aiven Console showing the "Load sample dataset" button.

After loading the data, connect to the PostgreSQL instance using the command below. The ``SERVICE_URI`` value can be found in the Aiven Console dashboard.

.. code:: shell

   psql 'SERVICE_URI'

Load Pagila manually
--------------------

1. Download the ``pagila-data.sql`` from our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/aiven/devportal/blob/main/code/products/postgresql/pagila/pagila-data.sql>`_.

.. Tip::
    You may use the following command on your terminal::

        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiven/devportal/main/code/products/postgresql/pagila/pagila-data.sql

2. Connect to the PostgreSQL instance using the command below. The ``SERVICE_URI`` value can be found in the Aiven Console dashboard.

.. code:: shell

   psql 'SERVICE_URI'

3. Within the ``psql`` shell, create a database named ``pagila`` and connect to it with the command below:

.. code:: psql

    CREATE DATABASE pagila;
    \c pagila;

4. Populate the database with the command below. This might take some time.

.. code:: psql

    \i pagila-data.sql;

5. Once the command finishes, make sure to reconnect to the database to access the imported data:

.. code:: psql

    \c pagila;

**You are ready to go!** You can use the :ref:`Sample queries<sample_queries>` section below to explore the database. Have fun!

Entity-relationship model diagram
---------------------------------

The image below shows an overview of the Pagila database tables and views, generated by `DBeaver <https://dbeaver.io>`_.

Here you can see how the tables relate to each other, through each fields. For example, the ``film`` table has string columns like ``title`` and ``description``. It also relates to the table ``language`` with the columns ``language_id`` and ``original_language_id``. With that information, you know that you can join both tables to get the language of each film, or to list all films for a specific language.

Ready for a challenge?
----------------------
After playing around with the sample queries, can you use SQL statements to answer some these questions?

1. What is the total revenue of each rental store?

.. dropdown:: See answer

    .. code:: sql

        select
            store.store_id,
