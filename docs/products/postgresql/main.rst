PostgreSQL® welcome
===================

PostgreSQL® is an open source, **relational database**. It's ideal for organisations that need a well organised tabular datastore.
On top of the strict table and columns formats, PostgreSQL also offers solutions for nested datasets with the native ``jsonb`` format and advanced set of extensions including `PostGIS <https://postgis.net/>`_, a spatial database extender for location queries.
Aiven for PostgreSQL is the perfect fit for your relational data. A scalable SQL database solution that can be up and running within a few minutes.
