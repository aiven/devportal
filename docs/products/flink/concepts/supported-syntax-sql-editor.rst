Built-in SQL editor
===================

The built-in Table SQL editor in the `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_ for Aiven for Apache Flink® service provides an intuitive interface that allows you to create source and sink tables, write queries, and analyze data in one place. Additionally, the editor includes an auto-completion feature for SQL keywords, which makes the query-writing process faster and more efficient for you and helps with data validation.

The interactive query feature also lets you preview the data of a Flink table or job without outputting the rows to a sink table. This is useful for testing and debugging your Flink application since it allows you to view the data that your application is processing.
