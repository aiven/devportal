Billing
-------

All Aiven services, including Aiven for ClickHouse, are billed based on actual usage, which means you only pay for what you use: no up-front fees and no termination charges.

The minimum hourly charge unit is one hour. Powering off or deleting a service stops the accumulation of charges immediately. We calculate your final bill based on your consumption over that period and deliver it as a single invoice per project. For generating a consolidated invoice across multiple projects, `manage billing groups in Aiven Console <https://docs.aiven.io/docs/platform/howto/use-billing-groups.html>`_.

Billing on partial hours

Minutes of usage is rounded to the nearest hour. However, the one-hour minimum charge unit still applies.
