Disaster Recovery testing scenarios
===================================

`Disaster Recovery <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery>`_ (DR) is the ability of software and/or services to handle extreme scenarios; this could be the failure of the software itself or an outage within a datacenter.

These situations are uncommon but can have a huge impact, so they need to be prepared for. Aiven provides this service to any Enterprise Support customers and can run these scenarios at your request up to 4 times per year.

What is a Disaster Recovery scenario?
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is a preset scenario where an Aiven specialist will simulate an issue with your service and `sabotage` one (or more) of your Virtual Machines. For example, with an Aiven for PostgreSQL® service, we can `sabotage` the Primary instance and test the failover functionality or we can sabotage both nodes to test recovery time for a complete outage.

What is needed?
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. At least 7 working days notice and the time (plus timezone) that you would like this carried out.
2. A `throwaway` service (i.e. one that is created specifically for this scenario and not a service used in Production).
3. The virtual machine and/or the availability zone that you would like to target.
4. An Enterprise Support contract.

How do we request this?
-----------------------------------------------------------

You can request this by opening a support ticket, emailing `support@Aiven.io <mailto:support@aiven.io>`_ or by contacting your Customer Success Manager.

How is it run?
-----------------------------------------------------------

* All communication during the exercise will occur in the support ticket.
* We will contact you to confirm the start of the scenario, the actions we will take and the service affected. The scenario will not begin until it is confirmed by you.
* Actions taken on the service and/or virtual machines will be communicated through the support ticket.
