About logging, metrics and alerting
===================================

Administrators can configure log and metrics integrations to Aiven services so that you can monitor the health of your service.

Logs
----

Choose **Manage integrations** from the service overview page to add an integration that will send service logs to an Aiven for OpenSearch® service. This can be an existing service, or you can choose to create a new one.

Metrics
-------

On the service overview page, choose **Manage integrations** to set up an integration to push service metrics to an M3, InfluxDB® or PostgreSQL® service on Aiven. This can be an existing service or you can create a new one to receive the metrics.

Dashboards
----------

You can create custom OpenSearch® or Grafana® dashboards to monitor the service.

Alerts
------

The platform also has alert policies to notify you via email when a key metric rises above or below a set threshold, such as low memory or high CPU consumption. For information on setting the addresses for these emails, see `this article <https://help.aiven.io/en/articles/5234705-technical-emails>`_.
