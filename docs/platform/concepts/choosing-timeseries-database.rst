Choosing a time series database
===============================

With its introduction, Aiven now offers a wide choice of open source
time series databases in its product portfolio.

-  Aiven for PostgreSQL® with the TimescaleDB extension is your best
   choice if you already use PostgreSQL, require **SQL compatibility**
   and have a limited time series use case.

-  Aiven for InfluxDB® is your best choice when your use case is fairly
   **small scale** and you want to get started with purpose built time
   series databases easily and **cost effectively** .

-  Aiven for M3DB is your best choice when you need a **truly
   scalable**, high performance time series database that is also
   **high availability.**
