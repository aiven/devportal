Tax information regarding Aiven services
========================================

Aiven services are provided by Aiven Ltd, a private limited company incorporated in Finland. 
This article describes our tax status in different jurisdictions. 
None of our marketed prices include value-added or other taxes.

European Union
--------------

Finnish law requires us to charge a value-added tax for services provided within the European Union (EU). 
The value-added tax percentage depends on the domicile of the customer.

For business customers in EU countries other than Finland we can apply the reverse charge mechanism of 2006/112/EC article 196 
when a valid VAT ID :doc:`is added to the billing information </docs/platform/howto/update-tax-status>` for a billing group.

United States
-------------

According to the tax treaty between Finland and United States no tax needs to be withheld from payments by US entities to Aiven. 
Although we believe a W-8 form is not required to confirm this status, we're happy to provide a W-8BEN-E form describing our status if needed.  
Please contact our `sales <sales@aiven.io>`_ to request one. 

Rest of the world
-----------------

No value-added tax is applied to services sold outside the European Union as described in Value-Added Tax Act of Finland section 69h. 
Finland has tax treaties with most countries in the world, affirming this status.
