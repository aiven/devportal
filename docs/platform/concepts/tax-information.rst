Tax information for Aiven services
====================================

Aiven services are provided by Aiven Ltd, a private limited company incorporated in Finland. This article describes our tax status in different jurisdictions. None of our marketed prices include value-added or other taxes.

European Union (EU)
-------------------

Finnish law requires Aiven to charge a value-added tax for services provided within the European Union (EU). The value-added tax percentage depends on the domicile of the customer.

For business customers in EU countries other than Finland, we can apply the reverse charge mechanism of 2006/112/EC article 196 when a valid VAT ID :doc:`is added to the billing information </docs/platform/howto/update-tax-status>` for a billing group.

United States (US)
-------------------

According to the tax treaty between Finland and the United States, no direct tax needs to be withheld from payments by US entities to Aiven. Although a W-8 form is not required to confirm this status, we're happy to provide a W-8BEN-E form describing Aiven's status. Contact the sales team at sales@Aiven.io to request one. 

Aiven does charge US sales taxes in several states in the US. The applicability of these taxes depends on various factors, such as the taxability of Aiven services, tax thresholds, amongst others.

Rest of the world
------------------

No EU value-added tax is applied to services sold outside the EU as described in the Value-Added Tax Act of Finland section 69h. Finland has tax treaties with most countries in the world affirming this status. Aiven reserves the right to charge any necessary taxes - similar to US sales taxes - depending on the local tax legislations of the customer.
