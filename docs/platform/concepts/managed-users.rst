Managed users 
==============

.. important:: 
    Managed users is an :doc:`early availability feature </docs/platform/concepts/beta_services>`. To use it, :doc:`enable the feature preview </docs/platform/howto/feature-preview>` in your user profile.

The managed users feature provides a centralized way of managing all of your organization's users, including editing their profiles, resetting passwords, and :doc:`setting authentication policies </docs/platform/howto/set-authentication-policies>`.

When you :doc:`verify a domain </docs/platform/howto/manage-domains>`, existing organization users automatically become managed users. 

A managed user cannot create new organizations unless they are a super admin of the organization that they are managed by. 

To see a list of all users in your organization go to **Admin** and select **Users**.
