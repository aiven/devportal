Password policy
===============

Aiven is committed to keeping your data secure. Creating a strong password makes it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access to your account. 

Creating a strong password is a first step in securing your account. You can add another layer of security by :doc:`enabling two-factor authentication </docs/platform/howto/user-2fa>`.

Password requirements
-----------------------

Aiven enforces the following rules for password strength: 

-  Minimum length is 8 characters

-  Cannot contain single repeating characters such as ``aaaaaaaa`` 

-  Cannot contain your name or email address

-  Cannot contain common words, phrases, or strings such as password, security, or common names

-  Cannot contain words that are very similar to common words such as ``password1``

These rules are also used for service integration passwords. For remote services (for example, sending logs to an external OpenSearch® service), these rules are not enforced, but they are recommended.


Password tips
-------------

The following are some suggestions for creating or resetting your Aiven password:

-  Use a password manager to create a randomly generated strong password

-  Use passphrases since these are harder to guess

-  Do not use the same password for multiple services
