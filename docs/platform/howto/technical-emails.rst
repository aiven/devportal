Receive Technical Notifications
===============================

After creating services on Aiven you will want to make sure you stay
up-to-date with what's happening to them.

One way to do this is to add one or more email addresses as contacts in
the Technical Emails section of the project settings.

These users will receive notifications related to plan sizes,
performance, outages and upcoming mandatory planned maintenance. If no
emails are specified, we will still send some high-priority
notifications (such as disks running out of space) to project admin
users.

.. Tip::
   Option to specify tags, tags are key-value pairs that allow you to categorize resources.

   **Billing Reference Tags:** Billing reference tags are returned in the Invoice API and are displayed both in the **"Billing"** section and on PDF invoices for this project.
   
   **Project Tags:** These tags are returned for resources in the API and are also displayed in the **"Projects & Accounts"** section of this project.
