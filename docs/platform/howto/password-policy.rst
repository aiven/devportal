Password Policy
===============

Aiven is committed to enhancing security of our customers and preventing hackers from accessing your account. Creating a strong password makes it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access to your account.

**Password Requirements**

To ensure your password is safer, Aiven enforces a number of password criteria that make sure that the password is strong:

-  Minimum password length is 8 characters

-  Cannot contain single repeating characters such as aaaaaaaa 

-  Cannot contain your name or email address

-  Cannot contain common words, phrases or strings such as password, security, John . Using common words or service names can be easily guessed.

-  Cannot contain words that are very similar to common words such as password1.

For **new user** sign ups, these requirements are automatically enforced.

For **existing customers**, while it is not required to change password immediately, it is strongly recommended to update your existing password. When changing your password, the above requirements will be enforced.

When creating **integration** passwords on Aiven's end, the above requirements are also applied. For remote services such as sending logs to external OpenSearch®, the requirements are not applied, but are recommended.

Additionally, when creating and/or resetting the password, please consider the following tips:

**Password Tips**

-  Use password manager to create a randomly generated strong password

-  Use passphrases instead of passwords which are even harder to guess

-  Do not use same password for multiple services

-  Select a password that is not usual and memorable only to you

Selecting a strong password is a first step in securing your account. In addition to creating a secure password, please refer :doc:`./user-2fa`.

If you forget your password, you may reset your password by selecting ``Forgot Password``  on the `Aiven web console login <https://console.aiven.io/>`_ page.
