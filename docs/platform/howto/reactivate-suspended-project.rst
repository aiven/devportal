Reactivate suspended projects
===================================

If you have bills past due and didn't set up a payment method, you may receive this error when trying to log in to the console:

  ERROR

  Project suspended, access prohibited

Reactivate a suspended project
-------------------------------------
To get access to the project again, open a support case by emailing support@aiven.io with the following information:

- Your full name
- Nname of the project
- Email address associated with the account

After you regain access, you can :doc:`provide a payment method </docs/platform/howto/manage-payment-card>` to avoid this issue in the future.
