Move from Aiven direct billing to Google Cloud Platform Marketplace
===================================================================

Aiven makes its services available through the Google Cloud Platform Marketplace.  If you already have some services running in a project which is billed directly through Aiven but you would like to move to a Google Cloud Platform Marketplace subscription without disrupting your services, this article shows the steps needed to gather the relevant information and submit the request.

Create a new account using a Google Cloud Platform Marketplace subscription
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the steps to :doc:`set up Google Cloud Platform Marketplace for Aiven Services <billing-google-cloud-platform-marketplace-subscription>`.  This will create a new empty project, which is where your services will be moved to.

Gather the required information
-------------------------------

Aiven will need some information from both your existing and your new subscriptions in order to perform the migration.

**From your existing Aiven account:**

* The name of the project (or projects) that contain the services you wish to move. 

**From your new GCP Marketplace subscription:**

* Your Account ID (in the format ``E-1234-1234-1234-1234``), as shown in the Aiven GCP console "Settings" screen

Send the request to Aiven
-------------------------

Once you have collected the information above, send it by email to `sales@Aiven.io <mailto:sales@Aiven.io>`_ and someone will be in touch to complete the process.
