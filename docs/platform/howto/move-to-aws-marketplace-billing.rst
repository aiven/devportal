Move from Aiven direct billing to AWS Marketplace
=================================================

Aiven makes its services available through the AWS Marketplace. If you already have some services running in a project which is billed directly through Aiven but you would like to move to an AWS Marketplace subscription without disrupting your services, this article shows the steps needed to gather the relevant information and submit the request.

Set up an AWS Marketplace subscription for Aiven
----------------------------------------------------------

Follow the steps to :doc:`set up AWS Marketplace for Aiven services <billing-aws-marketplace-subscription>`.  This will create a new Aiven organization, which is where your projects will be moved to.

Gather the required information
-------------------------------

Aiven will need some information from both your existing user account and your new subscription in order to perform the migration.

**From your existing Aiven user account:**

* The name of the Aiven projects that have the services you wish to move. 

**From your new Aiven organization with the AWS marketplace subscription:**

* The name of the new organization.

Send the request to Aiven
-------------------------

Once you have collected the information above, send it by email to `sales@Aiven.io <mailto:sales@Aiven.io>`_ and someone will be in touch to complete the process.
