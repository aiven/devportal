Assign projects to billing groups
=================================

When you create a new project, you can assign it to a billing group, which lets you :doc:`use the same payment card and consolidate costs</docs/platform/concepts/billing-groups>`. 

You can also assign the project to another billing group later in the `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_. 

.. note::

    Projects can only be assigned to one billing group. If a project is already assigned to one billing group and you assign it to another, it will be removed from the first group.

To assign projects to a billing group:

#. In the project, click **Billing**.

#. Select the billing group you want to assign the project to.

#. Click the **Projects** tab.

#. Click **Assign projects**.

#. Select the projects to assign to this billing group and click **Assign projects**.

#. Click **Cancel** to close the dialog box. You will see the newly assigned projects listed in this billing group.
