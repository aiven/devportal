Update your tax status
======================

You can add your VAT ID in the billing information in the Aiven Console:

#. Click **Billing**. 
#. Click **Billing groups**.
#. Select the billing group that you want to update.
#. Click **Billing information**.
#. In the **Billing details** section, click **Edit**.
#. Enter your **VAT ID** and click **Save**. 

You can change also the billing address by clicking **Edit** in the **Company  details** section. Once the billing country has been updated, it will be used in all future invoices. 
Billing estimates are updated approximately once an hour, so it may take up to an hour for the new tax status to become visible on the invoice estimates.
