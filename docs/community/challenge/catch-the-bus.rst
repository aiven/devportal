Catch the bus - Aiven challenge with ClickHouse®
===============

Welcome to Aiven's "Catch the bus" challenge, an easy way for you to explore Aiven for ClickHouse®. 

With the launch of Aiven for ClickHouse® we finally have the "C" for our KFC stack, the best combination of tools for real-time alerting and historic analytics. The stack utilises Apache Kafka®, Apache Flink®, and ClickHouse® to build up a robust, scalable architecture for getting the most from your data, whether it be batched ETL or real-time sensors.

For this challenge, we'll be using real-time data from `digitransit <https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/4-realtime-api/>`_ to plot maps and find new insights. Digitransit provides real-time bus information and positioning data for busses in Helsinki. We've saved you a few weeks worth of data as a CSV to experiment with.

Let's dive right in.

Instructions
------------
The goal is to find the best bus routes between the different KFC restaurants in Helsinki.

1. Create an Aiven free trial account here: `sign up for free <https://console.aiven.io/signup/email?credit_code=AivenChallengeBIGDATALDN22&trial_challenge=catch_the_bus>`_.
